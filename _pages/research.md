## Overview
We connect research in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, psychology and mathematics to tackle a wide range of problems across the field of intelligent vehicles and dynamical systems. Our group aims to develop innovative dynamic models and control algorithms to characterise and improve the behaviour of intelligent vehicles and mechanical systems in relation to safety, comfort, acceptance, naturalness and trust, provide fundamental insights into human-centric intelligent systems, and build next-generation of intelligent vehicles as well as robots to address challenges in human-robot interaction, decision making and control, human factors and transportation.

   <strong> Decision-making  of Intelligent Vehicles </strong><br>
  Within the complex and interactive environment, automated vehicles (AVs) not only need to avoid the dynamic and static obstacles,  but also need to coorperate or negotiate with other road users,  One critical challenge is that the AVs cannot socially behave   like rational human drivers when interacting with other road users, especially in interactive urban environments engaged with  heterogenous road users.  Our study is to develop human-centric decision making and control algorithms for AVs in relation to trust, acceptance and naturalness.
