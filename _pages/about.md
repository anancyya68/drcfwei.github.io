Before that, I was an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/wei.pan/) in Robot Dynamics at the Department of Cognitive Robotics and co-director of [Delft SELF AI Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/self-lab?languageSelect=UK&searchCriteria[0][key]=keywords&searchCriteria[0][values][]=SELFLab&searchCriteria[1][key]=Resultsperpage&searchCriteria[1][values][]=50), TU Delft, Netherlands and a Project Leader at [DJI](http://www.dji.com), China. I am on the editorial board of CoRL, IEEE RAL, ICRA, IROS and AAAI. I received my degrees from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and [HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). 

I have a broad interest in robot control using Bayesian machine learning and the principles of dynamic control.
