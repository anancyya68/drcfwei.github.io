I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/wei.pan/) at [Robot Dynamics Section](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/research/dbl-delft-biorobotics-lab/) as part of the [Department of Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). 

My research goal is to build intelligent and trustworthy machines by unifying machine learning and control theory.
