I am a [Senior Lecturer](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/wei.pan.html) (Associate Professor) in [Machine Learning](https://www.idsai.manchester.ac.uk/research/centre-for-ai-fundamentals/) and director of Robot Learning and Control (RLC) Lab at the Department of Computer Science and a member of [Centre for AI Fundamentals](https://www.idsai.manchester.ac.uk/research/centre-for-ai-fundamentals/) and [Centre for Robotics and AI](https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/), The University of Manchester, UK.  Before that, I was an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/wei.pan/) in Robot Dynamics at the Department of Cognitive Robotics and co-director of [Delft SELF AI Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/self-lab?languageSelect=UK&searchCriteria[0][key]=keywords&searchCriteria[0][values][]=SELFLab&searchCriteria[1][key]=Resultsperpage&searchCriteria[1][values][]=50), TU Delft, Netherlands and a Project Leader at [DJI](http://www.dji.com), China. I am an Area Chair or Associate Editor of IEEE RAL, ACM TOPML, CoRL, L4DC, ICRA, IROS. I received my degrees from Imperial College London, University of Science and Technology of China and Harbin Institute of Technology. 

I have a broad interest in robot control using Bayesian machine learning and the principles of dynamic control. Recently, I have been interested in human-AI/robots teaming.
